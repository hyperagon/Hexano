# Hexano
A piano with hexagonal keys. Vibe coded but it required me to correct several things

- Everything is packedn into a single *HTML* file
- Let's you pick different kinds of Wave
- Records the output into a *WAV* file
- Replays what was recorded like a piano roll
- Can *Import* and *Export* a melody to a *JSON* file
- Let's you *Import Audio* where it tries to guess the melody
- Contains several Instruments
