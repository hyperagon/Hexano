Make a single HTML page with everything inline.
Make a hexagon-tiled piano, with each tile representing a note.
There should be a bar on top that allows one to Record (circle that fills red when active) that saves a WAV with all the notes played if clicked after active, one to play to replay (show the keys pressed) or stop the previous melody, a wave style dropdown, a volume slider and a fullscreen svg button.
The notes are colored when pressed and pale colored otherwise.

Keyboard should work too.

if the width is smaller than the height the lower part should rotate.

don't touch their Y position that was correct the X position had a margin though and didn't line up withe their top row
